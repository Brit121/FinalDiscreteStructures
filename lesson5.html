                        A subset can be described as a smaller set that is contained within a larger set.
                        A set can only be considered as a subset of a given set if and only if all its
                        elements are elements of another set.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A subset is a set where all its elements are also found within another, larger (or equal) set,
                        meaning it's a part of the whole, like {1, 2, 3} being a subset of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} because 1, 2,
                        and 3
                        are in the larger set.

                    <p>
                        Let us have A = {1,2,3} and <br>
                        B = {1,2,3,4,5}
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Since elements 1, 2, and 3 of set A are also present in set B we can therefore say that “A is a
                        subset of B” or A ⊂ B.

                    </p>

                        Let us have P = {1, 3, 4} and Q = {2, 3,4 ,5 ,6}.
                        <br> <br>
                        The diagram shows that “P is not a subset of Q” or P ⊄ Q since although elements 3 and 4 of set
                        P are present in set Q, the element 1 is not.

                        A = {1,3,5}, B = {1,2,3,4,5}, and C = {2,8} </p>
                    <p>
                        The diagram shows that:
                        A is a subset of B or A ⊂ B because the elements 1, 3, and 5 of set A are also present in set B.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We can also say that C is not a subset of B or C ⊄ B because although 2 of set C is also an
                        element of B but 8 is not.

                        The diagram shows
                        A is a subset of B or A ⊆ B since elements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 of set A is also present in set B.
                        <br><br>
                        The situation where both sets have the same elements is called an improper subset denoted by the
                        symbol “⊆”.

                        If B is an empty set, meaning set B has no elements at all, it suffice to say that all its
                        elements (which is nothing) belong to set A regardless of the elements present in set A. This
                        proves that the empty set is a subset of every set.

                <p>A superset is a set that contains all the elements of another set with additional elements.
                    This means the larger set contains all the elements of smaller set, and at least one element of the

                        A is not a superset of B (A ⊅ B). Since set B has elements c, d, and e that are not present in

                        <br> <br>
                        No. Looking at the cardinality of both sets, it can be observed that set B has the cardinality
                        of 5 (B |5|) while set A only has the cardinality of 3 (A |3|), therefore it is impossible to
                        have A as a superset of B (A ⊅ B) since set B has a bigger cardinality than set A.
